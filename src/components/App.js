        We’re sending BAD out with a bang with a block party that will swallow
        up Fish Lane, hook, line and sinker.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presented by Blaklash, the BAD Block Party will kick off with an
        afternoon of markets from local First Nations makers including Rachael
        Sarra and Magpie Goose. Then take a behind the scenes tour of the
        laneway’s impressive collection of public artworks before returning to
        Town Square to sip cocktails amongst the lush greenery of Town Square.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stick around after dark and watch the lane burst into a riot of circus,
        dance and live tunes. It’s good to be BAD. Book a BAD Art Walk and Talk
        Tour here.
